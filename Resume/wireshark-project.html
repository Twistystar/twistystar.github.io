        <h2>Project: HTTPS Traffic Analysis Using Wireshark</h2>
            <p>
                In this project, I captured and analyzed network traffic using Wireshark while accessing multiple websites<br>
                over HTTPS. I applied advanced display filters to isolate TLS handshake packets and identify secure web traffic<br>
                on TCP port 443. Conditional logic was used to include and exclude traffic from specific IP addresses, ensuring<br>
                accurate filtering results. Parentheses were implemented in compound filters to control execution order and<br>
                prevent logical errors. The project demonstrated how encrypted web traffic can be identified, analyzed, and<br>
                narrowed down within a packet capture without decrypting payload data.
