        <h2>Project: Multi-LAN Network Configuration using Cisco Packet Tracer</h2>
        <p>
           Designed and implemented a simulated network environment connecting two separate LANs through a router.<br>
           Configured switches and PCs with static IP addresses, set default gateways for inter-network communication,<br>
           and enabled router interfaces to facilitate connectivity between subnets. Utilized Packet Tracer’s simulation<br>
           mode to test and visualize data flow, ensuring accurate routing and troubleshooting any connectivity issues.<br>
           Gained hands-on experience in network design, IP addressing, device configuration, and basic routing concepts.
